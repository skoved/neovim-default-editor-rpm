# neovim-default-editor-rpm
Configuration for building an RPM that sets neovim as the default editor in Fedora Linux.

## About
This rpm is based off of the
[vim-default-editor](https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/vim/vim-default-editor/)
RPM, which is provided by the Vim packagers in the Fedora Community. Unfortunately, the Neovim packagers have not
created a similar RPM for Neovim.

## Licensing
This repo contains some files which are modified versions of files found in the Fedora
[rpms/vim](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/vim/tree/rawhide)
repo. As of the time of writing this README, that repo does not contain a license file and is therefore governed by the
[Fedora compilation license](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/legal/fedora-linux-license/),
which, as of the time of writing, is the MIT license. All such files include headers that contain their license. These
headers also contain attribution and where they came from when possible. All other files provided are licensed under
